# Getting started

The purpose of the GC Forms API is to allow you to securely and reliably retrieve form submissions directly from an API endpoint. Our hope is that this will eventually alleviate the level of effort associated with the retrieval of data and the tedious confirmation flows for high volumes of form submissions. So, rather than having to manually download and sign off on the removal of responses to confirm their retrieval from the database, the API will automate the workflow with systems that talk to each other and exchange data. 

## What you will need

A GC Forms staging account (used for temporary testing only)
A form set to deliver responses via “Download” in Settings 
A few “mock” responses submitted to the form
A target system where you plan on receiving form submission data
An API key (generated by you in Settings > API Access) 
Infrastructure development resources who can craft HTTP requests and use Azure or AWS to reach the API
