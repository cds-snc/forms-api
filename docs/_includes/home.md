### Welcome

Welcome to the first iteration of the GC Forms application programming interface (API) and its technical documentation. This version of the documentation is for developers who want to use the GC Forms API to retrieve form submission data programmatically into their department’s web application or back-office system.

Our goal is to guide you through setting up an initial integration and securely retrieving form submissions, while also being able to learn from you in the process (for example: what’s challenging or what’s confusing) and then integrate your feedback into our upcoming iterations. We appreciate your patience as we continue to fill in the gaps and iron out issues along the way. Your open and honest feedback will help us improve GC Forms and shape the future of this product.
