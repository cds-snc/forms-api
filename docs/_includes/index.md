# GC Forms API Documentation
(Version 1 - Pilot/trial - Limited to prototyping partners only)

## Welcome 

Welcome to the first iteration of the GC Forms application programming interface (API) and its technical documentation. This lite version of documentation is for developers who want to use the GC Forms API to retrieve form submission data programmatically into their department’s web application or back-office system. 

Our goal is to guide you through setting up an initial integration and securely retrieving form submissions, while also being able to learn from you in the process (for example: what’s challenging or what’s confusing) and then integrate your feedback into our upcoming iterations. We appreciate your patience as we continue to fill in the gaps and iron out issues along the way. Your open and honest feedback will help us improve GC Forms and shape the future of this product.

## Overview

The purpose of the GC Forms API is to allow you to securely and reliably retrieve form submissions directly from an API endpoint. Our hope is that this will eventually alleviate the level of effort associated with the retrieval of data and the tedious confirmation flows for high volumes of form submissions. So, rather than having to manually download and sign off on the removal of responses to confirm their retrieval from the database, the API will automate the workflow with systems that talk to each other and exchange data. 

This first version of the documentation includes what you need to know about:
- Getting started
- Authentication
- Making requests
- Monitoring
- Getting support
